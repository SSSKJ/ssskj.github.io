<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m a CS Ph.D. candidate at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and a member of the [VLOG Lab@VT](https://sites.google.com/view/dawei-zhou/vlog-lab?authuser=0) leading by [Prof. Dawei Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/dawei-zhou/home). Before that, I obtained my M.S. in Data Analytics Engineering degree from Northeastern University, Boston and B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Sun Yat-sen University.

My research centers on graph machine learning, open-world machine learning and multi-modal learning. If you are interested in my research, feel free to reach out to me via skjguan@vt.edu.

[EVINET: Towards Open-World Graph Learning via Evidential Reasoning Network](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2506.07288)

**Weijie Guan**, Haohui Wang, Jian Kang, Lihui Liu, Dawei Zhou 

[**Github**](https://github.com/SSSKJ/EviNET) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data=''></span></strong>
- Address graph learning in open and noisy environments by jointly tackling misclassification and OOD detection.
- Propose EviNet, which leverages beta embeddings and subjective logic to model uncertainty for both known and novel classes.
- Demonstrate strong performance across classification, misclassification detection, and OOD detection through extensive experiments.
